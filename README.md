# ✈️ Flight Ticket Price Prediction 🎟️

A **Machine Learning–powered Streamlit web application** that predicts **domestic flight ticket prices in India** based on airline, route, travel dates, duration, class, stops, and time of travel.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Flight ticket prices vary dynamically due to multiple factors such as demand, airline policies, booking time, travel class, route distance, and departure time.  
This project simulates a **real-world airfare pricing system** using a trained ML regression model and an interactive Streamlit interface.

Users can:
- Select source & destination cities
- Choose airline, class, and stops
- Pick booking and flight dates
- View auto-calculated duration & arrival time
- Get ticket price with GST
- Calculate total cost for multiple passengers
